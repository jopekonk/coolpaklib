# coolpaklib
A simple Python3 library to remote control a Leybold COOLPAK 6000 compressor using RS-232 serial communication

This library tested only with the COOLPAK 6000 model, but may work with or without major changes with other models depending on the communication protocol.

## Prerequisites

Required libraries etc.
* Python 3.x
* pyserial  (Only pyserial should be installed on the system! Check with 'pip3 list'. To uninstall other serial libraries such as 'serial', use 'sudo pip3 uninstall serial')
